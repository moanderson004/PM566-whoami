# Intro to Public Health Data Science

You need to make a fork of this repository, find your name in the list below, and replace it with something like:

```md
[**@username**](https://github.com/username/) something about you
```

For example, this is what I did with mine:

> [**@ksiegmund**](https://github.com/ksiegmund) When I was in 6th grade I wanted to become an airline pilot. <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8010048?v=4" alt="github pic" width="40px"> 

Notice the figure of my username (that's optional and fun). This is the code I used of writing that line:

```md
[**@ksiegmund**](https://github.com/ksiegmund) When I was in 6th grade I wanted to become an airline pilot. <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8010048?v=4" alt="github pic" width="40px"> 
```

Look for your GitHub username and add a link to your Github profile and something about
yourself you don't mind sharing publicly. Remember to only modify the line with your
username! If you don't see your username, just add it at the end of the list (and see what happens!).

Once you are done, submit a
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to include your information in the original
repository.
